title:  "Overwatch's Civil Rights Movement"

It's easy to classify Blizzard Entertainment's new game *Overwatch* as "just another shooter".  But hidden beneath all the shooting, rocketing, freezing, healing, building, and teleporting is a really neat story hook.  The fundamental conflict in the Overwatch universe is an emerging civil rights movement.

*Overwatch*'s story begins with war. Intelligent robotic servants called omnics had become ubiquitous, and the AI-driven factories that created them (called omniums) had been built in most major cities on Earth.  At some point, and for reasons we still have not learned, the omniums began producing aggressive omnics which attacked humanity.  This conflict became known as the Omnic Crisis.  In an effort to end the war, the United Nations created Overwatch - a team of not-quite-superheroes given the mandate of ending the Omnic Crisis, which they did.

Following the Omnic Crisis, Overwatch was eventually disbanded.  An uneasy truce was adopted between humanity and omnics.  They may live together, but many humans blame the remaining omnics for the war waged by their kin.  It is not uncommon for omnics to be assaulted in the streets.  But in spite of the unjust aggression they face, many omnics are actively seeking a peaceful and equitable coexistence with humanity.  Omnics are on the cusp of their own civil rights movement.  These omnics are capable of violence, but they are also capable of affection, spirituality, empathy, sacrifice, and even art.

Enter an omnic named Tekhartha Mondatta.  Following the Omnic Crisis, Mondatta led a group of omnics in the founding of a monastery in the Himalayas.  There they experienced a “spiritual awakening” and determined that, like humans, they possessed souls.  The monks now seek to bring harmony to the relationship between humans and omnics.  Their message of peace and cooperation has been embraced by millions around the world, and they have become global celebrities.  One stop on their journey to spread their message of peace was in King’s Row, London - home to one of the largest communities of omnics.

Mondatta’s speech sets the backdrop for the events of the animated short, [*Alive*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyBUMabtslI).  The crowd is an even mix of humans and omnics, all present to support Mondatta and his call for peace.

“Before me I see the future," says Mondatta.  "Humans and omnics standing together, united by compassion, by common hopes and dreams."

These are the words that will galvanize the omnics and kickstart their civil rights movement.  And like any other civil rights movement, the omnics have allies.  Amongst the omnics and humans in the crowd is Tracer, a former member of Overwatch.

And don’t forget - Tracer was part of a group formed to end the Omnic Crisis!  She may have shot and killed omnics on the battlefield, and watched them shoot and kill her friends in turn.  She has every reason to be suspicious and resentful.

And now here she is, standing in the crowd at a rally promoting peace and equality between humans and omnics.

But Tracer isn’t the only notable person in King’s Row.  Widowmaker is on the rooftops, aiming to put an end to Mondatta and everything he stands for.  And after a truly jaw-dropping fight with Tracer, she succeeds.

Tracer doesn’t see this assassination as the death of a single omnic (neither does Widowmaker).  This was a shot at the heart of the peace movement, meant to incite more violence and hatred against omnics.

*“Why would you do this?  Why?!”*

And it looks like it worked.  The streets of King’s Row are covered in anti-omnic graffiti.  In Escort missions on the King’s Row map, the payload the attacking team is moving is an EMP meant to wipe out the omnic population in the city.  In Russia, the Second Omnic Crisis has already begun.

Tracer’s relationship to the omnics is reminiscent of allies in every civil rights movement that has ever taken place.  Tracer is white people in the 1960s, or straight people in the 2000s, or cisgender people today.  (Actually, since an accident in Tracer’s past causes her to suffer from “chronal dissociation”, she may very well have visited those periods.)  Whether the omnics gain the right to vote and become fully-recognized members of the global community or are wiped out by humanity, Tracer will not be affected.  This is not her fight anymore.  But she understands that the souls of both races are at stake here, and she is prepared to die for the cause.

The war with the omnics is ending, and the war for omnic civil rights is on the horizon.  This is the setting of the nascent Overwatch universe, currently depicted in *Overwatch* and a handful of comics and digital shorts.  I look forward to future story installments, and I commend Blizzard for the remarkable universe they’ve created for us to enjoy.
