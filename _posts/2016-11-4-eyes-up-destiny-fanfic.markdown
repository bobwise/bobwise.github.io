Adelaide was born in the light.  Outdoors in the light of a golden sun, blessed by the Light of the Traveler, and bathed in the incandescence of humanity at the height of its potential.  

Humanity was experiencing its Golden Age.  The mysterious Traveler had arrived on Earth centuries before - a massive inscrutable sphere floating above the surface. Somehow, its influence had caused humanity to experience an unprecedented explosion in their capacity to grow and learn.  Centuries of technological discovery transpired over the course of a few years.  Humanity experienced profound discoveries in the fields of medicine, mathematics, and engineering.  Human lifespan tripled.  Culture blossomed as humanity expressed their joy and delight with new music, literature, and art.  

It was a time of miracles.

In school, Adelaide learned of the night that came before the dawn of the Golden Age.  These stories always made her shudder with fear.  It was unthinkable to conceive of a time before the Traveler came.  Humans had lived for a single fleeting century (if they were lucky).  Their lives were fraught with peril, disease, and war.  They huddled together on a single lonely planet, spinning wildly through the cold blackness of space, hidden from the Light.

But fate blessed Adelaide to be born in the Golden Age.  Her parents loved her and raised her and her sisters to take advantage of all the joys The Traveler had brought to them.  Adelaide knew peace and love, and always felt empowered to pursue her passions.  She was an artist and a thinker.  Her thirst for knowledge could never be sated, and from a very young age she expressed the desire to read “every book that had ever been written”.  Her parents laughed when they heard this, but that did nothing to diminish Adelaide’s ambition.

Sevris was born in the incomprehensible void between worlds.  It was dark aboard her ketch, always dark.  Her earliest memories were of the harsh cruelty of the Vandals that took gleeful joy in taunting the Dregs.  Dregs, the sodden waste left behind when the Bigger and Better had taken what they wanted.  That’s what Sevris was.  Waste.

Dregs were expendable.  When the ether started to run low, it was the Dregs who would have to go without.  “You don’t deserve our protection,” the Vandals would say.  “We have taken your second arms, and now you cannot even defend yourself.  You deserve whatever happens to you.”

Life was cruel to all of the Eliksni, and the House of Devils was no exception.  When the Great Machine had abandoned them and The Whirlwind had scattered their people, the Devil Baron Naksis had pledged loyalty to a prime servitor named Sepiks and joined the dwindling fleet that sought to track down the Great Machine and reclaim the glory they had once known.

ATTONE, cried the Devil Baron.  BEG FORGIVENESS, AND PERHAPS GOD WILL RETURN TO US.  But at night, when she was alone in her cell, and the cold and the dark pressed in around her, and the throbbing pain from the stumps of her second arms kept her awake, it wasn’t forgiveness that Sevris yearned for.  It was vengeance.  Vengeance on the Devil Vandals who kept her trapped in her station, vengeance on the Whirlwind for sundering her people, but especially vengeance on the Great Machine for taking its light and abandoning her people to die in the dark.

Adelaide is in her prime, with a family of her own.  She is happy, but she has heard rumors about the Warminds detecting anomalies near the outer planets.  She has dedicated her life to the study of Light and its relationship to The Traveler.  Sometimes, if she spends enough time gazing at surface of The Traveler, pondering its inner workings, she thinks she can sense a deep, brooding unease.  Not fear, not yet, but there is something there.  Something unknown.  The Traveler is restless.

Later she would deal with the guilt that came from wondering if she could have led her people down a different path.  But she kept her suspicions to herself, and when the Warminds declared an extinction level event and the invaders began razing her world to the ground, she panicked alongside the teeming masses.

Word moved quickly through the Eliksni fleet, so it did not take long for Sevris to learn that they had arrived at their destination.  After years of pursuit through the cold void of space, hounding after the fleeing Machine, it had finally come to rest, and they had found it.

It seemed that the Great Machine had found a new home and had a new family now.  They called themselves “humans”.  Sevris hated them.  They were everything that the Eliksni were not.  Long-lived, peaceful, and happy.  But their peace had made them docile, and they mustered little defense when the Eliksni descended upon them.

The Great Machine was located on the eastern continent and the bulk of the Eliksni fleet was sent to reclaim it.  But when they arrived, they learned the terrible truth - The Great Machine was dead.  These humans - these stepchildren - had bled it dry and consumed its Light for themselves.

Some of the Eliksni had hoped to beg the humans for asylum from the pursuing Whirlwind.  It was worth it if it meant being able to again bask in the radiance of the Great Machine.  But when they learned the fate of the Great Machine, the slim chance of a peaceful coexistence was tossed aside.  With their god dead, they had lost what they most desired.  Even when the Whirlwind had destroyed their homeworld, many had resolutely clung to the hope that they could someday reclaim what they had lost.

And Sevris saw her opportunity.  She was among the first to call for war, and it did not take long for the rest of her House to take up her rallying cry.  VENGEANCE.  She rode with the House of Devils, shrieking on the wind as they descended on the humans.  VENGEANCE FOR THIS BETRAYAL.  These soft pink grubs had taken her god and killed it.  Her people had spent generations in darkness, seeking the light that these creatures had extinguished.

Naksis, the Devil Baron recognized the bloodlust in Sevris and promoted her to Vandal.  She was permitted to finally grow out her second arms.  It took several years for them to gain full strength, but it only took a few months for her to acquire enough strength to snap brittle human bones.

Adelaide’s parents were dead.  They had returned to their home in London only a day before The Fallen burned it to the ground.  News from overseas was less and less reliable with each passing day, but there was no doubt of what had happened.  Earth was lost.  There had been no word from the extraplanetary colonies in weeks.  Humanity was being exterminated.  The creatures that hounded them were merciless, ruthless, and bloodthirsty.  To humanity - a race that had known centuries of peace - the rage of the invaders was impossible to comprehend.  At this point, with The Traveler fallen silent and ash in the air, the only option was to run.

And run they did.  Adelaide and her family took what they could carry and headed for Russia.  In a final act of desperation, the massive shipping yards on the eastern coast had been hastily retrofitted into a Cosmodrome, and fleets of colony ships were being built and launched as quickly as possible.  Adelaide hoped to be on one of those ships before The Fallen made it that far east.  

She succeeded in getting her family to the Cosmodrome, but fate stopped her journey there.  At the age of 324, Adelaide contracted her very first illness. She failed the medical screening and was forced to say goodbye to her family at the boarding terminal.  As the disease burned through her body, she breathed her last ragged breath at the edge of the Cosmodrome, the flare of the ships rockets reflecting from her eyes as it thundered its way to safety.

The humans called them Fallen - which was certainly poetic.  Long gone were the dreams of peace and light and warmth.  The Eliksni, the Fallen - had accepted their fate.  They had once been great, even greater than the humans, but that time had long since passed and it could never be reclaimed.  All that was left was the deep smoldering rage of a people who had lost everything and had no hope of ever getting it back.

That rage fueled Sevris’ rise through the ranks of the House of Devils.  Eventually Baron Naksis promoted her to Captain and sent her on a special mission.  A powerful weapon had been located deep beneath the frozen ground in a remote region of the planet.  This weapon was one of the few that had posed a real threat to the Eliksni during their initial invasion, and it appeared to now be abandoned and vulnerable.  The humans called it Rasputin.

It is mid-morning in eastern Russia.  The sunrise has burnt away the frost but has done nothing to quell the biting wind as it cuts through the ruins.  This place has been deserted for a very long time, and the dead have long since gone to their rest.  But today something is different.  For the first time in a very long time, there is life in the Cosmodrome.

The sun reflects brightly off of a shining, fist-sized contraption.  It is made of metal and Light, but there is more to it than just mechanics.  It darts through the ruins, humming to itself.  It stops here to peer thoughtfully at some long-abandoned wreckage, then moves on to ponder the ancient remains of a human who died in the Collapse.

It has searched for a long time, this Little Light.  It has crossed the world searching for something, for someone.  And its long search is finally reaching its end.

Sevris was eager to complete her mission, but she would still follow protocol.  Before entering the Cosmodrome she surveilled the area, and was surprised to find a suggestion of life in the long-abandoned wreckage of the human fleet.  The scope on her Shock Rifle confirmed what she suspected - a Ghost.  A fragment of the Great Machine, discarded during the final battle and now wandering hopelessly, attempting to find the whole it had lost.

Ghosts were harmless, but were known associates of the few remaining humans that still took refuge beneath the carcass of her god.  It posed no threat, but it had been a long time since Sevris needed to feel threatened to turn to violence.

The Little Light can barely believe his luck.  He has found her!  His Guardian!  After all these years…

What’s that?  A Fallen signal!  Damn the luck!  After all these years of carefully preparing exactly what he would say, exactly how he would guide this lost soul back into the world of the living, and exactly how he would gently ease her into this new cruel world, he has to cut things short.

Only one thing for it then.  He takes a moment to center himself, closes his eye, and concentrates.

A burst of Light, a rush of wind, and it is done.  He hears her gasp, sees the rise and fall of her chest, and knows that it worked.  This is her - his Guardian.  He has found her and revived her, and now he needs to guide her.

Her eyes open and she pushes herself up onto her knees.  She blinks in the sun, shivering.

She is scared, but there is little time.

“Eyes up Guardian,” he chirps.  “You are going to see some things you do not understand.”

Sevris watches through her scope as the human woman flees deeper into the Cosmodrome.  A Guardian!  It seems the relationship between the Guardians and these “ghosts” is more interesting than she had thought.

No matter.  The hunt is on.
