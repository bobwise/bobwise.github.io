###Prologue - An Impossible Wind

Wherever they are, each player experiences the following simultaneously:

>You are suddenly very dizzy.  Your vision begins to go dark around the edges and you feel light-headed.

With a DC 15 Constitution check, the player is able to maintain consciousness.

If the player is conscious, they experience the following:

>Your field of vision goes suddenly, completely black.  You feel the ground drop away beneath you, but you do not feel any sense of being in motion.  Pinpricks of light swim into view, growing and spreading into a vast starfield.  You feel as though you are being carried by an impossible wind, swept away through the night sky.  The lights grow brighter and wilder.  You are moving faster and faster.  The stars stretch into blurred streaks across your vision, swirling and whizzing by at incredible speeds.
>
>And then, as suddenly as it began, it is over.  You find yourself standing calmly on a rocky slope in an utterly unpleasant place.  

Players who lost consciousness wake up prone.  

>The land around you is rocky, scorched, and uninhabitable.  The sky is shrouded in dark, toxic-looking clouds.  The earth rumbles as gas and stone shift deep beneath you.  Great rifts in the earth glow with an angry red light, and gouts of flame and molten rock can be seen bursting through the earth in the middle distance.
> <a href='/assets/images/stoneforge/hedron2.png'><img src='/assets/images/stoneforge/hedron2.png' style='width: 50%; position: relative;float: left; margin: 20px 20px 20px 0;'/></a>
>
>Another thing you notice immediately is the strange stone structures throughout the landscape.  They are shaped like 8-sided diamonds, and vary in size from small enough to hold in your hand to the size of a building.  On their faces are intricate runic carvings, though you cannot discern any meaning from them.  Many of the larger stones are floating high above the ground.  Some drift through the air, impossibly, as if they weigh no more than the clouds.
>
>You are standing on a narrow path that has been worn into the rock face by years of passing travelers.  The slope above you is at a steep angle and cannot be traversed at normal speeds. 50 feet up the slope it curves out of view. The slope below tapers out into craggy volcanic flatlands.  
><a href='/assets/images/stoneforge/akoum_art.png'><img src='/assets/images/stoneforge/akoum_art.png' style='margin-top: 25px; width: 100%;'/></a>


With a DC 15 Perception check, players can just make out the city of _Affa_ in the distance.

Players have the opportunity to look around and check their health and belongings.  

**Once the players are ready to get going...**

>[CHARACTER_NAME], you notice some movement at the top of a nearby ridge.  As you watch, a strange creature comes skittering into view.  It is the size of a small dog, but that is where the resemblance ends.  It stands on sharp, spindly legs like an insect.  It has a stark white bony shell with dozens of blue and magenta tentacles snaking out of the front and back. These tentacles weave aimlessly through the air around it.  Watching it, you are reminded of a stalking serpent.

The players are unable to identify the creature.  If the players do not attack, the Eldrazi eventually notices them and hisses for its compatriots to attack.

###Encounter 1 - Magenta and Crimson
**Encounter Level** Easy (600 exp per player)

![Map](/assets/images/stoneforge/map_1.jpg)

**Setup**

Eldrazi Scion x 3 (S)

**Features of the Area**

The upwards slope of the mountain is at a steep angle.  Moving in this direction requires double movement.  Downhill movement is unimpaired.

**Read this...**

>The Eldrazi Scions come tumbling down the slope, landing in a horrifying crash of tangled tentacles and legs right in the middle of the party.  
>
>Have the players make a DC 13 Dexterity check to avoid being knocked prone.  Those who are knocked prone also roll immediately against the Eldrazi Corruption effect.
>
>After the second round (once the players have learned a hard lesson about Eldrazi Corruption), Nissa and Ashaya arrive.  Ashaya bursts up from the ground beneath an Eldrazi spawn, possibly destroying it in the process.  Nissa appears from around a bend in the path leading down into the valley.

**Treasure**

* 45 copper coins
* 17 silver coins

**Tactics**

The Scions will always move to attack the nearest target, even if there is a more vulnerable target nearby.  They will scramble frantically towards their prey, but are smart enough to avoid tumbling down the slope again.

Ashaya will take up a defensive position and attempt to draw the Scions away from the players and onto her.

Nissa will heal players if their wounds are grievous and will dive into the fray with her sword if the Scions get away from Ashaya.

**Aftermath**

Nissa greets the party initially with suspicion.  She asks the party where they are from and what they are doing here.  She isn’t surprised to hear they are from another world, and she offers no explanation as to how they came to be on Zendikar.

**If asked about the Eldrazi…**

>They are called Eldrazi.  We drove them from our world thousands of years ago, and now they have returned.  They are driven by an eternal hunger for mana.  They drain the essence from everything they touch, corrupting it to dust.
>
>If I cannot find a way to stop them… [ she rests her hand on one of Ashaya’s limbs and bows her head reverently ] … Zendikar will die.  Everything, every...one… will die.

**If asked about Ashaya…**

>Ashaya is… my friend.  Zendikar sent her to me from the heart of this world to help me on my journey.

**If asked about the hedrons…**

>Nobody knows where they came from.  The hedrons have magical properties, especially when it comes to the Eldrazi.

**If asked about the Eldrazi corruption...**

>Do NOT let them touch you!  With a single touch, the Eldrazi will begin corrupting your flesh.  As the mana is drained away, you will turn into… that.  [She gestures to the bleached dust covering the battlefield and the surrounding mountain side.]

**If asked about her staff…**

>A friend gave it to me.

**If asked about why she’s in the mountains...**

>I am travelling to a place called the Temple of Talib.  It is the sanctum of Nahiri the Prophet, Voice of Talib.  She was the key to defeating the Eldrazi last time, thousands of years ago.  I am hoping to find something there that can help save us now.
>
>Akoum is dangerous, and nowhere more so than the Teeth.  If you would like, we can travel together.

**If asked about the Temple of Talib…**

>The Prophet of Talib lived and worked at the Temple of Talib.  The Prophet called Talib to Zendikar, and Talib and his brother and sister drove the Eldrazi away.

**If asked about Talib...**

>Talib, Kamsa, and Mangeni are the gods that saved Zendikar from the Eldrazi. We don’t know where they came from, but we know the Prophet of Talib called them here.  Maybe they can help us fight the Eldrazi again.

**If asked about traveling between worlds...**

>I believe you are who you say you are.  I don’t know how you came to be here, and I’m sorry that I won’t be able to help you get home.  The nearest town is Affa.  It’s about a day’s journey back along the road.  Somebody there may be able to help you.

**If the players are done asking questions…**

>Akoum is dangerous, and nowhere more so than the Teeth.  If you would like, we can travel together.

**If the players aren't convinced that they want to join Nissa…**

>[ Ashaya’s limbs rustle as she gestures indistinctly.  Nissa nods and turns to the group ]
>
>The Temple of Talib is also well-loved by treasure hunters.  If you help me get what I need you’re more than entitled to anything valuable you find on the way.

Once the players agree to join Nissa and Ashaya, you can skip straight to Encounter 2.

###Encounter 2 - The Temple Entryway###

**Encounter Level** Medium (2000 exp per player)

![Map](/assets/images/stoneforge/map_2.jpg)

**Setup**

Eldrazi Scion x 3 (S)

Eldrazi Hunter x 1 (H)

Players need to purge the area around the entrance of Eldrazi and place a hedron in the stone golem to reactivate it and gain entry to the Temple of Talib.

When the map is set up, read this to the players…

>The Temple of Talib is in a mountain, but it was not excavated.  It is almost as if the mountain grew naturally into this shape.
>
>The entrance to the temple is a simple rectangular double door in the  face of the mountain.  The stone door is closed and barred, and a massive Stone Golem stands guard before the door.
>
>Rocky outcroppings obstruct your view up the slope passed the door.

**Features of the Area**

The entrance to the temple is a massive stone doorway that is blocked shut.  An enchanted stone golem can grant entry, but the golem has gone still since running out of power.  The golem can be reactivated by placing a charged hedron into its chest cavity.  Once activated, it opens the door and stands aside, ignoring the players.

This area is beginning to fall under the influence of Ulamog’s corruption.  Much of the surrounding countryside has been reduced to dust.  Eldrazi in the immediate area are in the process of consuming a band of goblin scavengers when the players arrive.

<a href='/assets/images/stoneforge/akoum_art2.png'><img src='/assets/images/stoneforge/akoum_art2.png' style='width: 100%;'/></a>

**Treasure**

* 32 gp

* 1x Driftglobe

* 3 hedrons

>A battered crate lies at the center of the pile of corpses.  You force it open and find a sphere of thick glass.  Careful examination reveals that this is a _Driftglobe_ (DMG p. 166).

<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 25px;" >
    <img style="margin-right: 15px;display: inline;" src='/assets/images/stoneforge/driftglobe.png'/>
    <img style="display: inline;" src='/assets/images/stoneforge/hedron.png'/>
</div>

**Tactics**

Ashaya will take up a defensive position and attempt to draw the Scions away from the players and onto her.

Nissa will heal players if their wounds are grievous and will dive into the fray with her sword if the Scions get away from Ashaya.

Scions will move towards the closest enemy and use Bite.

Stalkers will attempt to grab players with their tentacles when possible.

**Aftermath**

**When the players find the hedrons, Nissa says…**

>These stones are called hedrons.  They are imbued with powerful magic.

Describe to players how Hedrons can be used.

<span id='interlude1'></span>

---

###Interlude 1 - At the Gate###

Before entering, the party takes a short rest near a trio of decrepit statues.  Nissa tells the party about the Prophet of Talib.  According to Nissa, The Prophet heralded the arrival of Talib, who helped drive away the Eldrazi with the help of his siblings, Kamsa and Mangeni.

>Zendikar has always been a world of powerful magic.  That magic causes life to thrive here, but it also calls to darker forces.  The Eldrazi (Nissa indicates the spongy blue and magenta corpses littering the area) are drawn to mana like a moth to a flame.  We don’t know where they came from or how they found us, but they did.
>
>The Eldrazi do not eat, drink, or breathe like we do.  They consume anything living, and they feast upon mana however it manifests.  Everything they touch is corrupted, turning to dust.
>
>Talib and his siblings heard The Prophet’s cry and came to Zendikar in our hour of need.  They used the magic of the hedrons (Nissa indicates the large stone diamonds in the sky, as well as the smaller ones scattered around the area) to imprison and destroy the Eldrazi.
>
>That was two thousand years ago.  We don’t know why the Eldrazi are returning, but our hope is that we will find something in this ancestral fortress that can help us.  Maybe instructions for how to summon Talib and his siblings, or more weapons like the ones we found here.

A DC 10 Perception check on the statues reveals an inscription:  

>Kamsa, Talib, and Mangeni
>
>The Saviors of Zendikar

A DC 15 Perception check reveals that the statues are of a Merfolk, Kor, and Angel, respectively.

A DC 19 Perception check reveals that the bony helmet on Mangeni is reminiscent of the bony plates on the Eldrazi brood.

###Encounter 3 - The Workshop###

**Encounter Level** Hard (3000 exp per player)

![Map](/assets/images/stoneforge/map_3.jpg)

**Setup**

Eldrazi Skyblight x 4

Eldrazi Devastator x 1

Near the entrance, players find 4 stationary hedrons.  Exploration reveals that they’ve been drained of the mana that powers them.  

The room is swarming with Hedron Crawlers.  They ignore the players unless attacked.  These each drop 1 hedron when killed.

Destroying a hedron or Hedron Crawler within 5 feet of a Large Hedron will cause the Large Hedron to float 10 feet in the air.  One player may ride each Large Hedron at a time, and players may move 3 squares per turn while riding a Large Hedron.  If they fall or jump off, the hedron stays in the air until it runs out of power.

![Falling](/assets/images/stoneforge/falling.png)

Players need to get all 4 hedrons in the air and into a specific configuration.  This aligns them with a nearby leyline.  Once all 4 hedrons have been aligned, the leyline moves and the hedrons need to be realigned.  This must be done 3 times to end the fight.  The players can move the hedrons into positions either by powering them and flying them into position, or by dragging them across the floor and then powering them to lift them into position.

Nissa can sense the leylines and will activate them when the hedrons are in location.  She does not participate in this fight other than to direct the players and throw heals in dire situations.

When the players enter the room, the only monsters are the Hedron Crawlers.  After the hedrons have been aligned for the first time, flying Eldrazi Skyblights spawn and harass the players.

After the hedrons are aligned for the second time, an Eldrazi Devastator spawns and beats on the players.  The Devastator can be killed if the players roll well, but the goal should be to make them feel the helplessness of fighting against the Eldrazi swarm, and the idea that teamwork (aligning the hedrons) can overcome obstacles they would otherwise find insurmountable.

After the hedrons are aligned for the third time, all Eldrazi in the Temple of Talib are turned to stone and the entrance to The Prophet’s Sanctum is revealed.

**When the players enter the area, read this…**

>This is the main workshop floor of the Temple of Talib.  It is clear that the purpose of this place is to create hedrons.  Half-carved hedrons litter the open room.  Worktables and shelving are stacked with hammers and chisels of all shapes and sizes.
>
>You’ve seen a lot of strange creatures today, so you aren’t especially startled by the strange creatures you see now.  All around the room are small stone spider-like creatures. [Show picture]  They appear to be each holding a small hedron like the ones you found outside.
>
>At the near end of the room is a storage area that seems to have been used to store completed hedrons.
>
>Nissa steps forward and surveys the room. “This place is… powerful.  My connection to the mana leylines of our world has been fading ever since the Eldrazi began to reappear, but in this place I feel…”
>
>“This is a conflux.  An… intersection.  There are four different leylines overlapping here.  The Prophet must have chosen this location for her Forge to take advantage of the powerful magic here.”
>
>Due to the conflux of leylines, all attack rolls and ability rolls for magical weapons and abilities have +1 while the caster is in the Temple of Talib.

**Features of the Area**

The workshop is a high-ceilinged room with windows high on the walls.

Several completed hedrons are piled in a storage area near the entrance.  The players can power these with hedrons from the Hedron Crawlers.

Four mana leylines converge in this room.  By aligning the ridable hedrons with the leylines, Nissa can reactivate the Temple of Talib and awaken the Prophet.

**When the players inspect the completed hedrons, read this…**

>Nissa places a hand on one of the hedrons.  “These hedrons are attuned to the leylines in this room.  I think if we can move the hedrons into position, the hedrons will funnel the power of the leylines into the Temple of Talib.  Maybe that’s how the Prophet called to Talib?’
>
>‘But there’s a problem.  The leylines converge about 10 feet above us, and those hedrons are far too heavy for you to lift.’”

**When the players learn how to power the hedrons, read this…**

>Nissa: “That’s it!  If you can move those hedrons into the right positions, I can activate the leylines and activate the Temple of Talib!  We can do this!”

**Treasure**

* 6 x 50gp gems
* Periapt of Wound Closure (p 184)
* Brooch of Shielding (p 156)
* Boots of Striding and Springing (p 156)
* Gloves of Missile Snaring (p 172)

<div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 25px;" class='encounter2_loot' >
    <img style="margin-right: 15px;display: inline;" src='/assets/images/stoneforge/periapt.png'/>
    <img style="margin-right: 15px;display: inline;" src='/assets/images/stoneforge/brooch_shielding.png'/>
    <img style="margin-right: 15px;display: inline;" src='/assets/images/stoneforge/boots_striding.png'/>
    <img style="margin-right: 15px;display: inline;" src='/assets/images/stoneforge/gloves_snaring.png'/>
</div>

**Tactics**

Hedron Crawlers will all shuffle randomly around the room until attacked.  When the number of Crawlers is less than the number of players, 5 more Crawlers will spawn at the beginning of their next turn.  If the players are running short on time, have the Crawlers die immediately if the player lands a hit on them.  If you need to stretch time, give the Crawlers 3 hit points.

Skyblights will spawn in perfect position to each attack one of the players on the floating hedrons.  They swoop down and start biting.

The Devastator spawns in the middle of the room.  He will use his tentacle to grab players and lift them off the hedrons.  He will consume any remaining Skyblights to regain health.  It should be very difficult for the players to kill the Devastator without aligning the hedrons.

**Aftermath**

**When the final hedron is aligned for the final time, read this…**

>Nissa: “That’s it!  We did it!”

Anyone riding on a hedron at this point is thrown clear as the hedron locks into position.  Players may roll a DC 12 Dexterity check to avoid falling prone and taking fall damage.

>The air around Nissa begins to glow pale green as she channels the power of the leylines into the aligned hedrons.  The runes etched into the hedrons begin to glow with a dazzling blue light.  For a moment, you can even see the brilliant curves of the leylines passing through the walls, the hedrons, and each other.
>
>The runes glow brighter and brighter, and you can hear a high-energy whine gradually growing louder and higher in pitch.  The Eldrazi in the room begin to thrash about, throwing themselves against the walls and ground in apparent pain and confusion.
>
>With a blinding flash and a roar of released pressure, the energy in the hedrons is released.  All of the Eldrazi in the Temple of Talib are immediately transformed into solid stone.
>
>Nissa: _gasping_ “I think… I think it worked.  The energy from the hedrons was sent out along the leylines in a massive pulse.  I suppose that was the signal that Talib heard?  How will we know if…”
>
>The sound of grinding stone behind you causes you to turn.  A doorway has appeared in the stone wall of the room, leading deeper into the base of the mountain.  The room beyond is lit dimly by natural light, but you cannot see inside from here.

<span id='interlude2'></span>

---

###Interlude 2 - The Prophet’s Sanctum###

This sanctum is where The Prophet, AKA Nahiri the Lithomancer has been lying dormant for thousands of years.  Ever since the Eldrazi were imprisoned, she has slumbered here.  The alarms she set in place to warn her if the Eldrazi awoke failed, and The Prophet is not yet aware of their escape.

**When the players enter, read this…**

>This room appears to be the personal sanctum of The Prophet herself.  There is some sparse furniture covered in drawings and schematics for various hedron arrangements, as well as more hedrons in various stages of construction.

**Once the players have all entered the room, read this…**

>With a CRASH the door behind you slams shut, and the seams around it melt away, leaving nothing but a smooth stone wall.
>
On the other side of the room, a woman steps through the wall.  She has pale skin and white hair.  She is dressed in simple clothing, and she carries no weapons.  She moves through the wall as if walking through a veil of water.  It parts before her as if it had no substance at all.
>
>She plunges her hand into the rock beside her, which melts and foams around her milk-white hand.  She pulls her hand free, and she is holding a fully-formed, white-hot stone sword.

>The Prophet: “Who are you, and what are you doing here?”

Give the players a chance to respond.  If they don’t mention the Eldrazi, have Nissa do it.

>The Prophet: “No!  The hedron network… it failed!  The Eldrazi were supposed to be contained, and I should have been able to feel it when they began to worm their way loose.  I’ve… failed.  Zendikar is going to be destroyed.  There is no time to repair the hedrons that held them in stasis...”
>
>Nissa: “I don’t understand.  YOU stopped the Eldrazi?  With the hedrons?  Our histories say that it was Talib and his silbings, who you summoned here…”
>
>The Prophet: “Talib?  I don’t know that name.  The only one I summoned here is… them.  The Eldrazi.  I brought them here so my allies and I could lock them away somewhere where I could control them, where I could make sure they would never destroy another world again.”
>
>Nissa: “Talib is… the Eldrazi?”
>
>The Prophet: “One of three.  Ulamog, Kozilek, and Emrakul.  The Eldrazi Titans.”
>
>Nissa: “One of three… Oh no…”
>
>The Prophet: “You’ve activated the Temple of Talib, haven’t you.  That must be what finally awakened me.  We don’t have much time.  This facility was built to summon the Eldrazi to this plane, and you’ve just activated it again.  We won’t have long before they attack.  Quickly!  Arm yourselves!”

The players have the opportunity to acquire some weapon and armor upgrades.  When the players are ready, the Prophet opens the door back into the workshop, and Encounter 4 begins.

###Encounter 4 - Ulamog Returns###

**Encounter Level** Deadly (1000 exp per person)

**Setup**

**As the players enter the room, read this…**

>A massive force collides with the outside of the mountain, and the entire room quakes from the impact.  Shelves and hedrons are sent sprawling.  As you scramble back to your feet, Nissa cries, “Look!”
>
>The wall above the main entrance is changing.  The solid rock is going pale, turning white, and crumpling away.  Within seconds the patch of corruption on the wall is 10 feet across, then 20, then 30.  A pinprick of light suddenly blossoms, and a shaft of sunlight pierces down through the rapidly growing hole.
>
>And behind the hole, something very large is moving.
>
>You scramble to draw your weapons, and the wall comes down.  A huge cloud of dust goes up, blocking much of your view.  But it would be hard to miss what is outside.
>
>The Prophet: “Ulamog…”
>
>Ulamog is an Eldrazi bigger than any creature any of you have ever seen.  It towers above you, hundreds of feet tall.  Massive jagged arms swing low to the ground where dozens of horrible writhing tentacles propel Ulamog forward.
>
>And from the dust cloud in front of you, the Eldrazi come.
>
>Roll for initiative.

The players engage the Eldrazi in front of them, and Nissa summons Ashaya to try and slow down Ulamog.  There is nowhere to run.  The battle will quickly turn against the players.  Have Ulamog destroy Ashaya in one or two turns.

**When Ashaya dies, read this…**

>Ulamog wraps a massive tentacle all the way around Ashaya and lifts her easily off the floor.  The tentacle squeezes, tighter and tighter.  Ashaya thrashes back and forth, smashing her limbs futilely against the rubbery tentacle.  Nissa begins to scream.  You can see the Titan’s corruption taking hold of Ashaya.  The wood of her frame is becoming bleached and fragile.
>
>With a CRACK, the tentacle snaps what is left of Ashaya in two.  A shower of twigs and chalky white dust rains down onto the battlefield.  Nissa cries out,, then vanishes in a flash of green light.

**When the battle is about to be lost, or if a player is about to die, read this…**

>The Prophet pulls her sword free from the corpse of one of the Eldrazi and surveys the battlefield.
>
>The Prophet: This battle is lost.  Soon this world will be gone, just like all the others the Eldrazi have devoured.  I can tell that you are not from this world.  My power is nothing like what it once was, but I think I still have the power to send you back to your home.  Remember what you saw here.  Remember the cost of the hubris that brought these monstrosities to my home.
>
>The Prophet raises her hand, and walls of stone shoot up from the floor, tossing the Eldrazi away from you.  The floor beneath you suddenly gives out and you sink, as if the floor had suddenly turned to water.  Before you can even gasp in astonishment…
>
>You are home.  With a crash and clatter of armor and weapons you all come sliding sideways out of a wall in the room where you started, back at home.  Along with some bruises and cuts, it seems you’ve brought home a few other things from your trip to Zendikar.  All of the equipment and weapons you were carrying is still with you, as are the hedrons you had on you when The Prophet sent you home.  You also find mixed in with your possessions a few other items…

Choose a number of items from the rewards table that is appropriate for the group you are playing with.
