Jordan Semyon was restless.  A year of hiding in Barquisimeto had taught her to be patient, but patience only goes so far.  It had been a year of waiting.  A year of waiting for Chessani’s men to find them.  A year of waiting while Ani grew fat and slow and then gave birth to the chubby little baby now drooling on Jordan’s arm.  A year of waiting while she slowly convinced Ani that they should release the evidence against Chessani to the press.

Jordan stroked the baby’s hair.  He grasped at her fingers, rocked back and forth, kicked his legs.  She wasn’t the only one who was restless.  This city had been their home and their refuge, but not for much longer.  Truth be told, she would be relieved just to leave the memories behind.  This was the city where her old life had ended.  From where she sat on the bed, she could see the *Parque El Obelisco* where she was supposed to meet Frank.  Frank in his white suit and her in her white dress.  And instead of Frank in a white suit she had found Ani, who told her that she was a widow.

It felt like the end of her world.  It felt like she had died.  In a way, she had.  That Jordan was gone.  Her dreams, her ambitions, her desire - all of it had died just as surely as Frank had.

And Ani had been there to put her back together.  Ani had explained everything she knew about Chessani and the men who had killed Frank.  All about the crooked monsters who had dragged her husband away from her and from the life they were building together.

And now Jordan had a new life.  She barely recognized the woman she had been a year ago.

The door opened and Ani came in.  Jordan looked at her, a silent question passing between them.  Ani nodded her head, firmly, like she was trying to convince herself that she had done the right thing.  Jordan smiled and held the baby close.  *This is the end*, she thought.

Ani knelt in front of Jordan and pressed her forehead to that of her son.  Jordan could see how this had weighed on her.  Ani had spent her whole life proud of not needing anyone. It was seeing that in her that showed Jordan that there could be life after Frank’s death.  Maybe if the baby hadn’t come, Jordan would never have been able to convince Ani to turn over the evidence to the reporter in the next room.  But soon after arriving in Venezuela Ani had started to show.  She didn’t want to talk about the father, but she didn’t have to.  Jordan saw how Ani cried when she heard the news from Vinci.  It wasn’t hard to put together, and after that convincing Ani was easy.  Was Ani ok with raising the son of a convicted murderer?  No, of course not.  That meant they needed to clear Ray’s name.

“He’s restless,” said Jordan.

Ani pulled the baby sling over her head.  “Long trip ahead.”  She sounded so tired.  *She can rest soon*, thought Jordan.

Jordan helped settle the baby in the sling.  *He’s so small*.  She looked away quickly.  It wasn’t fair to Ani for her to be jealous.  Or to the baby, or to Frank, or to herself, most of all.  That life was over.  The family she had wanted had only been a possibility with Frank.  Frank was gone, so that life was gone.  She would never be a mother.

They gathered their things and left.  Nails was waiting for them outside.  The street was crowded and noisy. The *Divina Pastora* procession was well under way.  Venezuelans danced and cheered in the streets, waving streamers and sparklers.  The procession was to honor the patron saint of Venezuela, the *"Divine Shepherdess”* who was attributed with saving the city from a cholera outbreak over a hundred and fifty years ago.

*It must be nice*, thought Jordan, *to have someone rescue you*.

She led them through the procession and across the street.  Nails had arranged for them to buy a car from some locals several blocks from the hotel.

They made it to the garage without incident.  Jordan wasn’t expecting any trouble, but knowing what was coming had her tensed like a coiled spring.  They had planned their departure specifically to coincide with the *Divina Pastora*.  With millions of people crowding into the capitol, it would be that much easier to move around undetected.

The garage was small.  A battered sedan took up about half of the available floor space.  Two men came out of the back office as they entered.  Jordan closed the door behind them.  She could still hear the music from the street.

Nails approached the men and began speaking to them in a soft voice.  Jordan was ready.  Ani had coached her and explained what would happen.  This was the right thing to do.  The only thing, really.  Their hand was being forced.

Now that they had made contact with someone from the States, they couldn’t expect to remain hidden in Venezuela for much longer.  They would drive north to the coast, and from there arrange passage to Cuba.  From there they could travel to Haiti, or maybe even back to the States.  Spend some time moving north up the coast towards Canada.  The goal was just to stay on the move, one step ahead of Chessani, until the news story broke and it was safe to go home.

That’s what Nails thought anyway.

Nails pulled his cell phone from his pocket and dialed a number.  He glanced back at Jordan and Ani, then turned and walked away, bringing the phone up to his ear.

Jordan didn’t blame him, not really.  The payout from Frank was a lot of money, but a year had passed and circumstances had changed.  There was a baby in the mix now, and Ani and Jordan were deliberately putting themselves back into danger by going to the press.  Nails was doing what he needed to do to stay alive.  And so was Jordan.

Ani fired two shots before the Venezuelan men could even draw their guns.  Blood splattered the wall behind them, and they collapsed at once.  Ani strode forward, her gun smoking.  The baby began to shriek.  She held her hand over the baby’s ears and fired two more shots.

Nails was on the ground now, stunned.  Jordan approached him.  *Quickly now*.

“Wha… why…”  Nails was stammering.  This wasn’t going the way he had planned.  The way any of them had planned.

When Jordan rounded the corner of the car and Nails saw the gleaming knife in her hand, he turned to run.  But she was ready.  Ani had taught her well.

She slashed him once, just below his armpit.  He stumbled away from her, not even realizing he was already dead.  He made it 3 more steps to the door before he collapsed.  Blood soaked his shirt and was already spreading rapidly across the floor.

The baby wailed.

*Ani was wrong*, she thought.  *That was much shorter than 10 seconds*.

She moved towards Nails, careful not to let the hem of her dress trail in the rapidly expanding pool of blood.  She delicately plucked his cell phone from where he had dropped it.  It was still connected.

“Mr. Nails?  Hello?  What was that noise?  Are you still-”.

“Good evening, Mayor Chessani,” Jordan said into the receiver.

“What?  Who is this?  Where is Nails?!”

Jordan glanced down at Nails’s cooling corpse.  “Nails is dead, Mayor Chessani.  I cut his axillary artery and he bled to death in about 8 seconds.”

“WHAT!?  Who are you!?  What do you -”

“My name is Jordan Semyon,” she said.

“Who?  What are you… wait.  Did you say Semyon?”  The voice on the other end of the line was starting to sound frantic.

“That’s right, Mayor Chessani.  Jordan Semyon.  I’m glad to see my name rings a bell.  Mr. Nails was just calling to inform you that I am alive and in Venezuela.  I thought I would simplify things a bit and cut out the middle man.”

Chessani was struggling to regain some composure.  “And why should I care where you are?”

“I wanted to let you know that my friend and I have recently handed over all of the evidence we have against you to a reporter from the Los Angeles Times.  Within a week you will likely be arrested for your part in the corruption surrounding the high-speed rail project.”

“I don’t know what you’re -”

“See you soon, mayor.”  She hung up the phone.

Ani had already retrieved the keys from the pocket of one of the dead men.  Jordan joined her in the car, and 10 minutes later they were cruising down the highway towards the airport.  Jordan pulled out her bag to make sure she had the tickets.  

LAX. One-way.
