The scientists at Ecopoint: Antarctica tracked the storm for weeks before it finally turned against them.  And likewise, Snowball tracked the scientists.  He saw the subtle tensions between them as they grew increasingly worried.  He saw Mei, his only friend, withdraw into her own thoughts, and he could see the fear written on her face.

That was the moment that pushed Snowball to action.  He had always been content to be just a research assistant, but his time with Mei had changed him. She was more than another scientist - she was his friend. And when he saw her in danger, he knew he had to do something.

Snowball came up with the plan for the cryochamber himself, but he carefully placed the idea somewhere where Captain Opara could find it.  Opara predictably took credit for the idea, but Snowball’s only concern was for Mei’s safety.

Before long, the research team was ready to go into artificial hibernation.  They gave Snowball careful instructions to wake them when the storm was clear and then sealed themselves into their icy vaults.  Snowball checked and triple-checked the parameters on Mei’s chamber and then went to sleep himself.

A few months later, the atmospheric sensors detected an end to the storm and alerted Snowball.  He confirmed that the storm was gone and it was safe to awaken the researchers. But before he initialized the revitalization protocols he paused…

… Mei was safe. Trapped beneath several layers of ice and glass, but safe all the same.  And out there… out *here*… she would not be safe.

So Snowball made a decision.  He came up with the cryochambers as a way to protect Mei, and waking her up would only put her in more danger. So Snowball turned the lights off and went back to sleep.

Time passed.  Drifts of snow piled up against the walls of the station and blew away as the winds changed. Years drifted by. Until one day, Snowball was awoken by an alarm - the station’s solar generator had been destroyed by the elements and the reserve batteries were almost depleted.

This was a simple enough problem.  Snowball paused all ongoing research projects and disabled all station systems that weren’t dedicated to maintaining the cryochamber.  That should keep everyone safe for another few years.

Some time later, the low-power alarm woke Snowball again.  Now he was beginning to become frustrated.  How could he be expected to keep Mei safe without any power left in the whole station?  He had already disabled all non-essential…

… but wait.  There *was* a way to keep Mei safe. Non-essential systems had been disabled, but the definition of “non-essential” was changing as the station shut down around them. Mei’s safety was the only thing that mattered to Snowball, and he had protected her for too long to let her perish now. So he cut the power to the cryopods - all of them except Mei’s - and he went back to sleep.

A new alarm roused Snowball. A transmission on the Overwatch emergency frequency! It was time - after all these years - for Mei to wake up. Snowball could barely contain his joy. Mei would be upset at the loss of her colleagues, but Snowball had carefully orchestrated the cryochamber shutdown to make it look like a malfunction. He had protected her all these years, and he would protect her from the burden of his choice too.

The cryotube opened with a hiss. Mei yawned, stretched, and reached out to pet Snowball fondly.

“Rise and shine, sleepyhead!” Mei yawned.

Snowball chirped happily. It was time to get back to work.
